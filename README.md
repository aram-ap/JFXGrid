# JFXGrid (In-dev)
## A Fast and Customizable Heatmap Charting Library For JavaFX ðŸ’¥ðŸš€
JFXGrid is a heatmap imaging library with focus on performance optimized real-time data visualization of Matrices at over 60 Hz update rates. This library was made as a solution to the [ChartFx](https://github.com/fair-acc/chart-fx) default heatmap implementation which I found unsuitable for displaying data at video-playback speeds (> 60 FPS). 

---

### Why?
While developing an application for processing and visualizing LiDAR sensor information, I came into an issue where the current JavaFX Charting libraries available simply didn't have the performance target and other major requirements that I needed. My major points of issue with the available libraries (likely issues of my lack of understanding) came to this:
- Libraries like [ChartFX](https://github.com/fair-acc/chart-fx) are beautiful with many features. However, its heatmap implementation didn't offer what I needed for my use case.
- Issues rendering with speeds > 30fps (it is designed for 25fps so totally within spec).
- Issues visually, such as refusing to display pixels as squares (this was so frustrating I decided to make this).
- After utilizing [OjAlgo](https://www.ojalgo.org), a linear math and matrix operations library, its speed and memory optimizations with matrices made it incredibly appealing, so I implemented it into this library with success.

#### Note:
- [ChartFX](https://github.com/fair-acc/chart-fx/) is an amazing library with lots of functionality and performance, and I would recommend it over this in most other circumstances.
- Some general structures, such as the ability to add custom plugins and having separate datasets are inspired by ChartFX. However, most of the other implementations are self-build.
- This is currently in development while I port the code over from the application I originally made.
- Going through this code, you're going to find areas where I haven't commented, likely some bugs, and some messy areas. I'm continuously growing this, so if you have any suggestions or have any questions, feel free to contact me or add a pull request!

### How does it work?
- `JFXGrid` is the default Node which contains X/Y axis, data label, mouse pointer tools, and the heatmap image itself.
- Both the JFXGrid and Axis contain `Renderer` classes, which handle all drawing and visual updates.
- `Colorizer` is the class responsible for colored themes and turning data values into color. This class also handles normalizing and tone curves.
- `DataChunk` is the custom data group which contains a collection of data frames, and a pointer for going through the chunk in a timeline.
- `JFXDataset` is the encapsulating dataset which holds a DataChunk, and all the resources available to play the captured data in real time.
- `JFXDataDeque` is a type of dataset used for dynamic chunk loading. Its primary use is to reduce memory usage, enable binary data saving/parsing, and eventually asynchronous playback. 
- `JFXDatasetFactory` creates the dataset and imports data into the dataset. 
- `ImageGenerator` is a utility class that takes a dataset and colorizer and turns it into a bitmap image.
- `Plugin` objects are plug-in utilities that enable other functionality such as exporting data, zooming in and out, getting mouse cursor location and associalted values, averaging multiple frames together, and playing the frames in video playback

### Code Examples (still IN-DEV, so these are mostly non functional (for now)):
The basics (32 x 32 grid): 
```
  Pane root = new Pane();
  JFXGrid grid = new JFXGrid(32, 32); //The central JFXGrid javafx node
  root.getChildren().add(grid);
```
Adding data (based on previous example):
```
  //This library relies on the high speed performance of Oj-Algo, but has simple double[][] functionality as well.
  MatrixR032 testMatrix = MatrixR032.FACTORY.makeFilled(32, 32, RANDOM);
  DataChunk chunk = new DataChunk();
  chunk.add(testMatrix);

  //We add the 0 as the dataset placeholder for its unique id.
  //This is primarily used when utilizing the JFXDataDeque with many other datasets for sorting purposes.
  JFXDataset data = new JFXDatasetFactory(0).add(chunk);
```

Stylizer - turning the grid black and white (based on previous examples):
```
  GridStylizer style = grid.getStylizer();
  style.setStyle(Style.MONOCHROME);
```
