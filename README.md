# JFXGrid
## A Fast and Customizable Heatmap Display For JavaFX ðŸ’¥ðŸš€
JFXGrid is a heatmap imaging library with focus on performance optimized real-time data visualization of Matrices at over 60 Hz update rates. This library was made as a solution to the ChartFx default heatmap implementation which I found unsuitable for displaying data at video-playback speeds (> 60 FPS).

### How does it work?
`JFXGrid` is the default Node which contains X/Y axis, data label, mouse pointer tools, and the heatmap image itself.
